## Budget and Expense web app
A small project for intro JavaScript practice: https://iyanataylor1.github.io/finances-app/

If I continue working on this: 
- add a button to clear the Expense List rather than deleting each item individually.
- a button to clear the budget-total expenses-balance area.
- error handling and confirmation if the user tries to overwrite the existing budget.
- add user instructions (?)
- ability to toggle expense list items (click, drag, and arrange them)
- proper column alignment (one thing under the other, it looks left aligned with a set distance between expense names, cost, and icons)
